# Francesco Albanese's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! You'll find 4 sections on this site.

## Header

There are 4 links to click here: "About Me", "Education & Work", "Projects", and "Contact". Clicking each of these will scroll the page automatically to that section. The URL in your browser's web bar will also display the corresponding section. 

## About Me

Brief description of me. The image will expand when your mouse hovers over it. There are no links to click.

## Education & Work

Short background outlining where I went to school, where I work, and where I'm currently a student. There are no links to click.

## Projects

This section contains my current list of applications that are live. Clicking on the first large image will navigate to the application in a new tab. The three images below are not clickable and will not direct you anywhere. They will expand similarly to the other images when your mouse hovers over them.

## Contact

This section contains clickable social media icons. Clicking on the respective icons will open my profile on each site in a new tab. The email icon will open your default mailbox.
