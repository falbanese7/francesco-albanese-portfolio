# Francesco Albanese's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio!

A direct link to the deployed site is included below:

URL: https://falbanese7.github.io/francesco-albanese-portfolio/

This portfolio site is comprised of 4 sections.

## Navbar

There are 4 links to click here: "About Me", "Education & Work", "Projects", and "Contact". Clicking each of these will scroll the page automatically to that section. The URL in the viewer's browser's web bar will also display the corresponding section. If the viewer is using a mobile device or a monitor below 576px, the menu items will collapse into a clickable button that will be more mobile-friendly.

## About Me

Brief description of me. The image will expand when the viewer's mouse hovers over it. There are no links to click.

## Education & Work

Short background outlining where I went to school, where I work, and where I'm currently a student. There are no links to click.

## Projects

This section contains my current list of applications that are live. Clicking on the first large image will navigate to the respective GitHub repository in a new tab. The three images will direct the viewer to the GitHub repositories for each project. They will expand similarly to the other images when your mouse hovers over them.

## Contact

This section contains clickable social media icons. Clicking on the respective icons will open my profile on each site in a new tab. The email icon will open your default mailbox.
